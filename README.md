> A faster, cleaner, more beautiful app for goodreads users.

betterReads is a mobile app that leverages the power of [Famo.us](http://famo.us/) to streamline the goodreads experience for users. The official goodreads mobile app is in need of an update, and so we're using the [betterReadsAPI](https://github.com/betterReads/betterReadsAPI) to make our own goodreads app that removes the clutter and the glut of excess features and focuses on what users want: their books.

Here are some screenshot examples of the iOS app in action:

## Requirements

- Famo.us
- Cordova / PhoneGap

## Development

### Installing Dependencies

In order to run this app, you'll need the Famo.us engine and framework. These are in git submodules.
YOU CANNOT PULL DOWN THESE SUBMODULES UNLESS YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE FAMOUS INTERNAL GROUP.

To install the submodules from the root directory:
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Then you can open ```www/index.html``` in your browser. We recommend using iPhone emulation in Chrome Developer Tools to simulate the proper screen size and aspect ratio.

You may be able to run the app if you manually install the Famo.us engine from the publicly-released Famo.us starter kit ([download here](http://code.famo.us/famous-starter-kit/famous-starter-kit.zip?source=top)).
As Famo.us is brand-new technology and very much in flux, we cannot guarantee the compatibility of the public release with this project.

To run this as a mobile app, you'll need Cordova and the PhoneGap CLI.
To run from the root directory:

```sh
npm install -g cordova
npm install -g phonegap
phonegap run ios
```

This will build and start the app in the iOS Simulator (requires a Mac, XCode, and the iOS Simulator app).
You can try to run this app on other devices, but it's designed to primarily run on iOS.
